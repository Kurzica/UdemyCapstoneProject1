        <h1>Hobbies</h1>
        <hr />

        <h2>Gymming</h2>
        <p>I have a passion for fitness acquired during the pandemic. I find it really stress relieving and I'm very thankful it's something
            that's good for you as well! My usual go to is a 3 day weights split with swimming after or on 'off' days.
        </p>

        <h2>Languages</h2>
        <p>I'm sadly not bilingual, but have always been fascinated by those who are. A personal friend of mine is a virtual polyglot
            which amazes me. I am attempting to learn French to read and listen to French history as it is a personal fascination. Je veux tres bien parler le francais!
        </p>

        <h2>Gaming</h2>
        <p>Lastly, a timesink and something that's taken a backseat in recent years, I always enjoy sitting down for an hour and relaxing with a game.
            These days, it's mainly strategy games and the occasional sci-fi, but the previous two hobbies definitely take priority now.
